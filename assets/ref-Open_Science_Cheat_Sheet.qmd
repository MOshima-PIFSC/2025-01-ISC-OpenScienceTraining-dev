## Key terms  

-   **Repository**: A place to store code, files, and each file's revision history.   
-   **Local Computer**: Your physical computer.     
-   **Remote**: Computer that is located elsewhere and accessed over a network (e.g. the internet).  
-   **Render**: Generate documents, presentations and more.
    Produce HTML, PDF, MS Word, reveal.js, MS Powerpoint, Beamer, websites, blogs, books...  


## Git and GitHub  

### Starting a repository  
```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A(Do you have a directory already started on your local computer?  ) --Yes--> B(git init)
    A --No  --> C(git clone repository_url)


```

**`git init`**: Initialize a Git repository on a local computer.  
**`git clone repository_url`**: Copying an entire repository onto a local computer.  

### Making changes to repository  

**`git status`**: Check what files have changed.  
**`git restore filename`**: Undo changes to a file.  

```{mermaid}

    A(Local computer) --> B(Stage changes: git add)
    B --> C(Commit changes: git commit -m)
    C --> D(Push changes to remote repository: git push)
    D --> E(Remote repository)
```

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR 
    A(Remote repository) --> B(Pull changes from remote: git pull)
    B --> C(Local computer)
```

#### From your local computer  
**`git add`**: Stage changes for a local commit.  
**`git commit -m "short, descriptive message"`**: Commit changes to be tracked.  
**`git push`**: Push changes from local computer up to the remote repository.  

#### From remote repository  
**`git pull`**: Pull changes from the remote repository to your local computer.  
**`git pull origin main`**: Pull changes from the remote repository **main** branch to the branch you are on.  

### Branches  
**`git checkout -b branch_name`**: Create a new branch.  
**`git checkout branch_name`**: Switch to a different branch.  
**`git switch`**: Switch to a different branch.  

### Sample workflow

When working within a `git` enabled project it is generally good practice to not work directly on the `main` branch but to work in an alternative branch that can be pulled into the `main` branch.

1. If needed clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <url-to-repo.git>` where `<url-to-repo.git>` can be found on the repository website under the *green* code tab.

2. Create a new branch using `git checkout -b <branch_name>` where `<branch_name>` is the branch you would like to work in.

3. Set the upstream location so `git` knows where to push changes to using `git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>`.

4. Add/modify content within the repository and stage it for a commit using `git add`. You can stage all files at once using `git add .` or stage individual files using `git add <filename>`.

5. Make the commit using `git commit` and add a label for the commit using the `-m` flag, `git commit -m 'Sample commit'`. Steps 4 & 5 can be combined to commit all new files using the `-am` flag, `git commit -am 'Sample commit'`.

6. You can push the commit to the remote repository using `git push`.

7. If you are getting ready to merge your changes into a different branch, it is useful to pull that branch into the branch you are working in using `git pull origin <other_branch>`. Now you can push your updated `branch_name` branch using `git pull`.

8. You can now initiate a pull request from the Github reposository website to bring in the changes from `branch_name` into `other_branch`. This is also possible from the command line by switching to the `other_branch` using `git checkout other_branch` and then pulling in `branch_name` using `git pull origin branch_name`.


## VSCode  

An IDE (integrated development environment) that works well with many languages.  

### Side Bar Options  

#### File Explorer  
To browse the files in a project

#### Git GUI (Source Control)  
To interact with your GitHub repository  
![](static/VS-code-git.PNG)  

#### Extensions  
VS Code's version of the app store  
![](static/VS-code-extensions.PNG)   

#### R  
Similar to the options available in RStudio for viewing variables in your environment, function documentation, and installing packages.

### Command Palette  
Use the shortcut `ctl + shift + P` to access.  
![](static/VS-code-command-pal.PNG)  

### Terminal  
Can have multiple terminals of different languages running at a time.

## renv  

#### Initialize renv for a project  

**`renv::init()`**: Set up a project library for a new or existing project.  

#### Install new packages  

**`renv::install()`**: Install packages from CRAN, GitHub, etc..  

#### Lockfile  

**`renv::snapshot()`**: Update the lockfile with packages being used.   
**`renv::restore()`**: Reinstall the packages specified in the lockfile.  

## Shiny  

**`ui.R`**: the interactive user interface code (to show stuff)  
**`server.R`**: the code for computations and plotting (to do stuff)  
**`shiny::shinyApp()`**: launches the app

## Quarto  

#### Document format  
In the header yaml, specify what format(s) you want to create.  

```{.yml}
---
title: "Open Science Workflow Cheatsheet"
format: html
---
```

`format` options include:  

*   html  
*   pdf  
*   revealjs  
*   docx  
*   and more!  

#### Including code  
Include code blocks in a document  

```{{r}}
#| echo: true

x <- 2+2
```
```{r}
#| echo: false

x <- 2+2
```
Calculated values can be reported in text later: $x =$ `r x`.  

And control the output rendered in the document with execution options.  

| Option    | Effects                                |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| `echo`    | show/hide code in output               |
| `eval`    | do/don't run code                      |
| `include` | include/exclude code or results        |
| `output`  | include/exclude results                |
| `warning` | show/hide warnings in output           |
| `error`   | show/hide error in output and continue with render |


#### To render document    
To render a quarto file to the proper format, in your terminal (not R), run: 

```{.bash}
quarto render path/to/file/name.qmd
```
